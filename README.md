Intro:
In this project, we simulate the process of text decryption using genetic algorithm (GA). 
In addition, we test and compare and evaluate the three most commonly used approaches to GA (Normal, Lamarck and Darwin). 


Execution Steps:
	1. git clone https://github.com/YanivZimmer/CompBioEx2
	2. cd <PROJECT_DIRECTORY>
	3. python .\genetic.py
		(Note that we executed this project with python3.10 & python3.9 - but lower versions might work too)


(*) We tested this program on a Windows PC & Linux Ubuntu with Python 3.10 & python3.9 installed.
